# Portfolio
A portfolio is a way for you to showcase who you are, what skills you have, and most importantly the work you've done.

As a developer, your portfolio is going to be in the form of a website. The main goal of this website is to showcase yourself and your work in the best way possible.

It needs to make you stand out and it needs to make employers think "Whoa! I'd like to work with this person". Ultimately it will need to show them that you could be awesome to work with so they are compelled find out more about you.

A portfolio should therefore include some standard elements. Below are the bare minimum elements your portfolio must include.
